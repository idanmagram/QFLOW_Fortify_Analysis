# Power Side-Channel Analysis Frameworks

This repository describes two frameworks which can be used for pre-Silicon power side-channel analysis of digital circuit designs (i.e., at the RTL or gate-level netlist stage): **PLAN** (Power attack Leakage ANalyzer) and **FORTIFY**. QFLOW (Quantitive information flow) is implemented also (run_QFLOW.py)

## Setup

- Download and install Anaconda. Please refer to https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/ (steps 1 â€“ 10 under the section _Installation_).
- Check that the following line has been added to `~/.bashrc` file:

  `export PATH="/home/<user_name>/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"`

  (If not added, please add it manually, save and close the file. Restart the terminal for the changes to take effect.)
- Check whether `conda` is properly installed by running:

  `conda --version`

  `conda update conda`
- Clone this repo on your local system:

  `git clone https://github.com/avlakshmy/power-side-channel-analysis.git`

- Create the environment (named `psca`) using the `environment.yml` file in the root of the repo, by running the following command:

  `conda env create -f environment.yml`

  This installs the Python modules required for the tools to run (`tqdm`, `pyverilog`, `z3-solver`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `Verilog_VCD`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
- Activate the environment by running the command:

  `source activate psca`

The above steps need to be performed once initially. However, the last step has to be run, i.e., the environment must be activated each time before running any of the tools.

Please refer to the `plan/PLAN.md` and `fortify/FORTIFY.md` files for a more detailed description of PLAN and FORTIFY, as well as instructions to run the scripts for both tools for different sample designs.
